# 2D-shooting-Game
1. This shooting game is a throwback to some of the early 2D sidescrolling shooters.
2. The game map is built up using individual tiles arranged in a grid. There are three initial levels and a level 
   editor is included to allow for expansion of the game. 
3. The enemies have AI, which allows them to patrol their area back and forth until they spot the player at 
   which point they will stop and shoot.
